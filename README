ISSUES/CHANGES
--------------
- Currently runs with 20 max processes instead of 40. Was getting a "resource temporarily unavailable"
  message when trying to create new processes. Should be working accordingly though. When I ran ulimit, my 
  max user processes was set to 30. Not sure if this has anything to do with the issue. 
  
- Added -v parameter to toggle verbose on and off.
