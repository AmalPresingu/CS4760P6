ISSUES/CHANGES
--------------
- Currently runs with 20 max processes

- Added parameters to select memory request scheme and set n number of processes

- Alarm interrupt is set to go off after 10 seconds

OBSERVATIONS
--------------
The first memory request scheme gives more page faults / memory access since it is randomly
selecting the pages. 

The second memory request scheme gives less page faults since it is accessing some pages
for longer periods of time than the rest.
